# 🚀 `Selfhosting`
* First of all, to selfhost Sen'ichi, you will need to clone the repository!

* To do this, open Powershell on the folder that you want and type: `git clone https://github.com/SenichiBot/SenichiKord`

* Secondly, you will need to compile Sen'ichi! Open your Powershell in the root folder and type: `./gradlew build`

* On the next step, you will need to get the JAR file! go to `build/libs` after compiling!

* Drop the JAR file in an empty folder, open Powershell in the folder and type: `java -jar senichi-kord-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
 
* After running the JAR file, it will appear a configuration file, put your bot token and your prefix and then execute the command again!

* Well done!
# 😊 `Conclusion`

Don't use the same name as Sen'ichi, be creative, it’s not that hard to choose a name.

Keep in mind that the development team has nothing to do with what you do with Sen'ichi. We don't help with selfhosting.
