# ðŸš€ `Selfhosting`
> First of it all, to selfhost Sen'ichi, you will need to clone the repository!
>
>> To do this, open Powershell on the folder that you want and type: `git clone https://github.com/SenichiBot/SenichiKord`
>
>> Secondly, you will need to compile Sen'ichi! Open your Powershell in the root folder and type: `./gradlew build`
> 
>> On the next step, you will need to get the JAR file! go to `build/libs` folder after compiling!
> 
>> Drop the JAR file in an empty folder, open Powershell in the folder and type: `java -jar senichi-kord-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
> 
>> After running the JAR file, will appear a configuration file, put your bot token and your prefix then execute the command again!
> 
>> Well done!
# ðŸ˜Š `Conclusion`
>> Don't use the same name as Sen'ichi, be creative, itâ€™s not that hard to choose a name.
>
>>Keep in mind that the development team has nothing to do with what you do with Sen'ichi. We don't help with selfhosting.
